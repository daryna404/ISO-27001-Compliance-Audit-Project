# ISO-27001-Compliance-Audit-Project

**Project Overview**
As part of this project, I conducted a comprehensive audit of the IT department's security practices to assess their alignment with ISO 27001:2013 standards. My work involved reviewing existing policies, identifying compliance gaps, and recommending actionable improvements.

**Process and Methodology**

**1. Requirements Analysis:**

Studied ISO 27001:2013 Annex A controls, particularly those related to physical and environmental security (A.11) and access control (A.9).
Identified key compliance criteria for secure area management, endpoint protection, and privileged access management.

**2. Gap Analysis:**

Evaluated current practices such as visitor management processes, equipment siting, and endpoint security policies.
Identified non-compliance areas, such as lack of clear desk policies and insufficient security measures for working in secure areas.

**3.Recommendations:**

Proposed actionable solutions, including implementing biometric access controls, enforcing clear screen and desk policies, and enhancing endpoint security with whole-disk encryption and vulnerability management.
Suggested security awareness training for staff and regular audits to maintain compliance.

**4.Documentation:**

Prepared audit reports summarizing compliance levels, areas for improvement, and action plans.
Documented policies for equipment protection, visitor management, and privileged access control.
